Hiya! 

im Ame, and i want to create an open-source printer with custom modules (such as a scanner). This is my first big project so be patient :P


# Inspiration

Nicholas C Lewis and their open source inkjet project

Big greedy companies like certain companies based in Palo Alto ;)

Right now this is just a hobby project, i'll look where it is heading.
